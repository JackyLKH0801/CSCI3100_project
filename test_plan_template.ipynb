    "# Test Plan for POSTer\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a sample test plan for a Website named \"POSTer\". The most important sections include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Scope and Objectives --- Outlining what will be tested and what is excluded from testing.  \n",
    "2. Test Cases and Scenarios --- Expanding on the \"Scope and Objectives\" by providing a detailed breakdown of the scope, along with testing procedures and pass/fail criteria. Similar test cases and scenarios can be merged together.\n",
    "3. Team Roles and Responsibilities --- Defining who is responsible for each task.  \n",
    "4. Testing Approach & Timeline and Schedule --- Detailing how and when the tests will be carried out.\n",
    "\n",
    "This long document is just for demonstration and completeness. Your actual test plan does not need to be overly lengthy. Please do not spend much time, and simply provide very brief and clear text in the important sections.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Scope and Objectives\n",
    "This section outlines what will and will not be tested, helping to avoid scope creep and maintain focus throughout the testing process. It also establishes clear boundaries for the testing efforts.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Scope:\n",
    "The test plan focuses on ensuring the functionality, performance, and user experience of the Pokeman game. The following areas will be tested:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Core website mechanics (e.g., User Following, Account creation, Posting).\n",
    "- User interface (UI) and user experience (UX).\n",
    "- Multiuser functionality (if applicable).\n",
    "- Compatibility across supported platforms (i.e. PC).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Out of Scope:\n",
    "- Security issues.\n",
    "- Testing of third-party integrations not directly related to gameplay (e.g., external payment systems).\n",
    "- Hardware-specific performance testing beyond the officially supported devices.\n",
    "- Modding or hacking scenarios (basically security issues).\n",
    "- Some hard-to-test aspects of the software (please see Risk assessment and mitigation).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objectives:\n",
    "- Verify that the websitee meets functional and non-functional requirements, and provides a bug-free experience.\n",
    "- Ensure the website is free of critical design flaws.\n",
    "- Confirm that the website performs well under various conditions.\n",
    "- Validate that the game is ready for release and meets quality standards.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "### Types of Testing:\n",
    "- Unit Testing: Validate individual components (e.g., followers, user bio, login/logout system).\n",
    "- Integration Testing: Test interactions between different game modules (e.g., multiplayer functionality, db module and inventory system), from developers' point of view.\n",
    "- System Testing: Verify the game as a whole from the user's point of view, including gameplay, UI, and performance.\n",
    "- Regression Testing: Ensure that new updates or fixes do not introduce new bugs.\n",
    "- User Acceptance Testing (UAT): Gather feedback from players to ensure the game meets expectations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Methodologies:\n",
    "- Manual testing for gameplay and user experience.\n",
    "- Automated testing for repetitive tasks (e.g., regression testing).\n",
    "- Exploratory testing to uncover edge cases and unexpected issues.\n",

    "## 6. Risk Assessment and Mitigation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Potential Risks:\n",
    "1. Delays in Development: Could impact the testing schedule.\n",
    "   - Mitigation: Regular communication with the development team to adjust timelines as needed.\n",
    "2. High Bug Volume: May overwhelm the testing team.\n",
    "   - Mitigation: Prioritize critical bugs and allocate additional resources if necessary.\n",
    "4. Insufficient Resources:\n",
    "   - Risk: Lack of testers, tools, or devices.\n",
    "   - Mitigation: Prioritize critical test cases and borrow resources from other teams if needed.\n",
    "5. Intrinsic Untestability:\n",
    "   - Risk: Some features cannot be easily tested with automated testing tools. For example, features with highly complex algorithms, AI-driven behaviour, or dynamic decision-making processes that are difficult to predict or replicate in a test environment.\n",
    "   - Mitigation: Make the software be able to expose as many internal states as possible. For example, for a game AI, provide a debug mode that outputs and logs decision-making steps to help testers understand its behaviour.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 7. Success Criteria\n",
    "- All critical and high-priority bugs are resolved.\n",
    "- Game meets performance benchmarks on all supported platforms.\n",
    "- Positive feedback from UAT participants.\n",
    "- All test cases pass with no major issues.\n",
    "- Game is approved for release by stakeholders.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 8. Reporting Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "### Documentation:\n",
    "- Description of the test cases in the code repository or dedicated test repository.\n",
    "- Test case execution reports.\n",
    "- Bug reports with detailed descriptions, steps to reproduce, and screenshots/videos.\n",
    "- Weekly progress updates to stakeholders.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Communication:\n",
    "- Regular meetings with the development team to discuss testing progress and blockers.\n",
    "- Final test summary report to stakeholders before release.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This test plan provides a structured approach to ensure the website is thoroughly tested and ready for release."
