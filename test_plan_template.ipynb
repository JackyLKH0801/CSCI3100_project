    "## 6. Risk Assessment and Mitigation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Potential Risks:\n",
    "1. Delays in Development: Could impact the testing schedule.\n",
    "   - Mitigation: Regular communication with the development team to adjust timelines as needed.\n",
    "2. High Bug Volume: May overwhelm the testing team.\n",
    "   - Mitigation: Prioritize critical bugs and allocate additional resources if necessary.\n",
    "4. Insufficient Resources:\n",
    "   - Risk: Lack of testers, tools, or devices.\n",
    "   - Mitigation: Prioritize critical test cases and borrow resources from other teams if needed.\n",
    "5. Intrinsic Untestability:\n",
    "   - Risk: Some features cannot be easily tested with automated testing tools. For example, features with highly complex algorithms, AI-driven behaviour, or dynamic decision-making processes that are difficult to predict or replicate in a test environment.\n",
    "   - Mitigation: Make the software be able to expose as many internal states as possible. For example, for a game AI, provide a debug mode that outputs and logs decision-making steps to help testers understand its behaviour.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 7. Success Criteria\n",
    "- All critical and high-priority bugs are resolved.\n",
    "- Game meets performance benchmarks on all supported platforms.\n",
    "- Positive feedback from UAT participants.\n",
    "- All test cases pass with no major issues.\n",
    "- Game is approved for release by stakeholders.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 8. Reporting Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "### Documentation:\n",
    "- Description of the test cases in the code repository or dedicated test repository.\n",
    "- Test case execution reports.\n",
    "- Bug reports with detailed descriptions, steps to reproduce, and screenshots/videos.\n",
    "- Weekly progress updates to stakeholders.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Communication:\n",
    "- Regular meetings with the development team to discuss testing progress and blockers.\n",
    "- Final test summary report to stakeholders before release.\n",
